# Tracking The Fun Noise in NYC  


As co-founder of sound system design and acoustics consulting startup __[Stampede Sound](http://www.stampedesound.com)__ here in NYC, one of the principal goals of our operation has been to reduce noise transmission for small clubs and bars in the city while improving sound quality with our proprietary speakers and acoustical knowledge. Of all places to achieve this in the US, NYC is likely the most challenging: high population density, hundreds of bars and venue spaces in close proximity to residential spaces, and constantly changing neighborhood boundaries. 

A low density part of town can transform into an enterainment center and population center within just a few years and with it, shifting expecting for residents of that neighborhood. Both the businesses that serve the residents and new residential property construction are in a complicated dance with each other.    

Beyond the incredible cost of operating a bar or nightclub, there is one threat to the longevity of these establishments that is most existential: 311 Noise Complaints. No matter how succesfull, a sustained period of 311 Noise Complaints from residential neighbors can permanently shut down the operation.   

To track down the biggest offenders in this business space would be a huge boon not just for my company but any services that attempt to improve a part of the the urban entropy which keeps the neighbors and businesses biting their fingernails. 

Come, the __[NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)__

One of the most rewarding technical enterprises I have been involved with, the SoundDrip music recommendation application was a labor of love spanning several months and a dedicated Data Science team that I had the pleasure of leading. 

Data Science Highlights:

* Aggregated the largest publicly available dataset featuring Spotify song metadata and acoustical features. The dataset is now in circulation at Lambda School for future labs projects.
* Launched Flask endpoints on AWS EBS instance  
* Tracking user interaction data via AWS RDS backend
* Containerized on ECS for decreased latency
* Developing supervised learning solution after amply user interaction data is collected
